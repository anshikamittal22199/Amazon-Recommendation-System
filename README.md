# Amazon-Recommendation-System
Description
Building recommendation system for products on Amazon.
Recommender systems help customers by suggesting probable list of products from which they can easily select the right one. They make customers aware of new and/or similar products available for purchase by providing comparable costs, features, delivery times etc.
Online Ecommerce wesites use many recommendation models to provide different suggestions to different users.
Amazon currently uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real time. This type of filtering matches each of the user's purchased and rated items to similar items, then combines those similar items into a recommendation list for the user. In this project we are going to build recommendation model for the electronics products of Amazon.
This project tries to solve problems confronting present recommender systems such as how to improve the degree of automation, how to make algorithms run faster and more robust with parallel computation.
Collaborative filtering is commonly used for recommender systems. These techniques aim to fill in the missing entries of a user-item association matrix. We are going to use collaborative filtering (CF) approach.
